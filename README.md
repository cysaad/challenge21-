# SMS Spam Predictor w/ Simple Gradio Interface

This challenge turns as SMS text classification solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. 

Also, the trained model needs to be accessible via a simple on-line user interface.  So, a Gradio app will need to be created to host the application, enabling users to test text messages. The application will provide feedback to users, indicating whether the text is classified as spam or not, based on the model's performance.
